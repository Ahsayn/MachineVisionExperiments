# MachineVisionExperiments
Some Machine Vision Experiments with OpenCV4 and Python

## Getting Started
Create a Python environment using a package manager of your choice (Conda, venv, etc.). You will need to install the following library dependencies
..* Numpy
..* Keyboard
..* Pillow
..* OpenCV-Contrib-Python 
..* Scikit Learn

## Additional Files
You will need to find your own video files in order to run the excercies. I used a number of mp4 files, but cannot share them.
